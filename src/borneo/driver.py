class NoSQLHandle(object):
    """
    NoSQLHandle is a handle that can be used to access Oracle NoSQL tables. To
    create a connection represented by NoSQLHandle, request an instance using
    :py:class:`NoSQLHandleConfig`, which allows an application to specify
    default values and other configuration information to be used by the handle.

    The same interface is available to both users of the Oracle NoSQL Database
    Cloud Service and the on-premise Oracle NoSQL Database; however, some
    methods and/or parameters are specific to each environment. The
    documentation has notes about whether a class, method, or parameter is
    environment-specific. Unless otherwise noted they are applicable to both
    environments.

    A handle has memory and network resources associated with it. Consequently,
    the :py:meth:`close` method must be invoked to free up the resources when
    the application is done using the handle. To minimize network activity as
    well as resource allocation and deallocation overheads, it's best to avoid
    repeated creation and closing of handles. For example, creating and closing
    a handle around each operation, would incur large resource allocation
    overheads resulting in poor application performance.

    A handle permits concurrent operations, so a single handle is sufficient to
    access tables in a multi-threaded application. The creation of multiple
    handles incurs additional resource overheads without providing any
    performance benefit.

    With the exception of :py:meth:`close` the operations on this interface
    follow a similar pattern. They accept a Request object containing
    parameters, both required and optional. They return a Result object
    containing results. Operation failures throw exceptions. Unique subclasses
    of Request and Result exist for most operations, containing information
    specific to the operation. All of these operations result in remote calls
    across a network.

    All Request instances support specification of parameters for the operation
    as well as the ability to override default parameters which may have been
    specified in :py:class:`NoSQLHandleConfig`, such as request timeouts, etc.

    Objects returned by methods of this interface can only be used safely by
    one thread at a time unless synchronized externally. Request objects are not
    copied and must not be modified by the application while a method on this
    interface is using them.

    For Error and Exception Handling, on success all methods in this interface
    return Result objects. Errors are thrown as exceptions. Exceptions that may
    be retried may succeed on retry. These are instances of
    :py:class:`RetryableException`. Exceptions that may not be retried and if
    retried, will fail again. Exceptions that may be retried return True for
    :py:meth:`RetryableException.ok_to_retry` while those that may not will
    return False. Examples of retryable exceptions are those which indicate
    resource consumption violations such as
    :py:class:`OperationThrottlingException`. Examples of exceptions that should
    not be retried are :py:class:`IllegalArgumentException`,
    :py:class:`TableNotFoundException`, and any other exception indicating a
    syntactic or semantic error.

    Instances of NoSQLHandle are thread-safe and expected to be shared among
    threads.
